This repository stores code of the algorithm designed for polyps detection and segmentation in colonoscopy images.
This repository was created as a semester project at FEEC at the Brno University of Technology.
The code for polyp detection and segmentation is implemented in MATLAB. 

For evaluation of detection with our algorithm run function evalPolyps whose input argument is path to your dataset 
(for more details see function documentation)
